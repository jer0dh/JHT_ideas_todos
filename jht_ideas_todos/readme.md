## JHT Ideas Todos WordPress Plugin ##

This plugin is more of a development play thing. 
 
 * Adding a custom post-type with a class-based plugin
 * Using WP Ajax and creating a CRUD based single page app to view and add ideas
 * Using `gulp` task runner to 
    * convert from ES2015
    * run Unit Tests with `gulp-jasmine`
    * create an app module to run in production
    * using MVC programming technique without help from Angular.  Data-binding is done using [Rivetsjs](//rivets.js.com)
